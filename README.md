Scripts to check internet speed and tweet it with image

Based on this DIY:
http://makezine.com/projects/send-ticket-isp-when-your-internet-drops/

that uses:
https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/speedtest-cli-extras

I modified the script("speedtest-ifttt.sh") adding a call to a script to tweet the internet speed and the image generated by http://speedtest.net : 

the line added was:

#Tweet current speed
python twitter_python.py "download: $download upload: $upload" "$share_url"

the first parameter is the text of the tweet, the second is the image URL
